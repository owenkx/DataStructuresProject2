/**
 * TODO: Replace this comment with your own as appropriate.
 * AVLTree must be subclass of BinarySearchTree<E> and must use inheritance 
 * and calls to superclass methods to avoid unnecessary duplication or copying
 * of functionality.
 * 1. Create a subclass of BSTNode, perhaps named AVLNode.
 * 2. Override incCount method such that it creates AVLNode instances instead 
 *    of BSTNode instances.
 * 3. Do not "replace" the left and right fields in BSTNode with new left and 
 *    right fields in AVLNode. This will instead mask the super-class fields 
 *    (i.e., the resulting node would actually have four node fields, with 
 *    code accessing one pair or the other depending on the type of the
 *    references used to access the instance). Such masking will lead to
 *    highly perplexing and erroneous behavior. Instead, continue using the
 *    existing BSTNode left and right fields. Cast their values to AVLNode 
 *    whenever necessary in your AVLTree. Note: This may require many casts, 
 *    but that is o.k. given that our goal is to reuse methods from BinarySearchTree.
 * 4. Do not override dump method of BinarySearchTree & toString method of 
 * 	  DataCounter. They are used for grading. 
 * TODO: Develop appropriate JUnit tests for your AVLTree (TestAVLTree in 
 *    testA package).
